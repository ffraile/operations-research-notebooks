They believe in using their powers to protect the people and promote equality and justice) and the BrotherHood party (This party represents a group of mutants who feel oppressed by society and seek to overthrow the existing power structures). They are competing in an election. Each party has three possible strategies: they can focus their campaign on young citizens (below 30), middle-aged citizens (30-50), or senior citizens (over 50). The parties use national statistics to estimate the number of votes that can shift in each demographic group (undecided voters). Here are the estimated values for each demographic group:\n",

    "- **Young voters:** If both parties focus on young voters, the Avengers party will get 40% of the young voters and the Brotherhood party 60% of the young voters. If the Avengers party focuses on the young voters and the Brotherhood party does not, the Avengers party will get 70% of the young voters. If the Brotherhood party focuses on the young voters and the Avengers party does not, the Avengers party will get 10% of the young voters. If neither party focuses on the young voters, the Avengers party will get 40% of the young voters.\n",

If the Brotherhood party focuses on the middle-aged voters and the Avengers party does not, the Avengers party will get 30% of the middle-aged voters. If neither party focuses on the middle-aged voters, the Avengers party will get 60% of the middle-aged voters.\n",
