    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "Doctor Stephen Strange is the chief surgeon at the Metropolitan General Hospital in New York. Doctor Strange needs to decide whether to perform surgery or not on a patient with a rare disease. If the patient dies, the hospital must pay a 3M€ compensation, and the cost of the surgery is estimated in 1.5M€. Based on available data, the medical department estimates that the probability of the patient surviving without surgery is 20%, while the probability of the patient surviving with surgery is 75%. Let us use operational research to determine if Doctor Strange should hold the knife:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a.** Draw the decision tree to support doctor Strange with this decision problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**b.** Solve the decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "**c.** Doctor Strange can use a procedure with a device known as the Eye of Agamoto to get additional information of the result of the surgery, with a cost of 0.5M€. Draw the decision tree incorporating the use of the Eye of Agamoto in the decision problem\n",
