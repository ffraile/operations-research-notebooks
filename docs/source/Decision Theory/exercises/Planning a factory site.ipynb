    "Dinoco, a multinational firm in the automobile sector, is deciding on whether to build an assembly plant in Brazil or in Mississipi (USA). The cost to build this plant in Brazil is \\\\$10 million and \\\\$20 million in Mississippi. Nonetheless, if the firm builds this plant in Brazil and local demand drops over the following 5 years, the project will be stopped and the firm will lose \\\\$10 million (and it will still have to build a plant in Mississippi). A priori, Dinoco believes that the\n",
    "probability of demand for cars dropping in Brazil over the following 5 years is 20%. For 1M\\\\$, it can contract a market research firm to analyse demand for cars in Brazil, which will indicate whether demand for cars will drop or not.\n",
    "The market research firm’s record indicates that his record shows that they are able to predict the occurrence of a drop in demand with a 95% success rate, and 90% when the demand does not drop.\n",
