    "You are the trainer of a basketball team playing an inter-university tournament over a weekend. You won the first game of the tournament yesterday, and now  you have to decide whether to play with the same starting 5 or make changes in the team. You want to assess your decision considering the possibilities of winning ($p_w$) or loosing($p_l$) the game and of having any player injured ($p_i$) or all healthy ($p_h$) after the game. Since it is a friendly tournament, your priority is that none of your classmates ends up injured, so you establish the following priorities between the utility values of the possible outcomes: v1 (victory – no injuries) > v2 (loose – no injuries) > v3 (win – any injured) > v4 (loose – any injured)."
