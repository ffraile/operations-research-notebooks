Decision Theory and Game Theory
=============================================
This chapter provides an introduction to decision theory, where we will focus on solving decision problems whre the
decision maker must select among various alternatives, which provide different performance. The chapter also covers
game theory, a field dedicated to modelling and solving decision problems involving several rational decision makers.
Here, we will focus on solving decision problems where the decision maker must select among various alternatives,
focusing on competition and collaboration.
This chapter contains the resources listed in the following table of contents.
