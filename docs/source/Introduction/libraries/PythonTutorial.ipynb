    "[Python](https://www.python.org/Python) is a high level programming language that is particularly suited for data science and operations research. Python has three main versions labelled 1, 2, and 3. Within each version, there are several minor releases, like 2.2 and 3.3. Therefore, there are many Python versions labelled  1.x, 2.x, 3.x, where the x is the minor version number. This course covers 3.x, but it is not difficult to change from one version to another.\n",

For some libraries, first we will need to install the library in our environment, normally using Conda (but we could also use other tools like pip).
