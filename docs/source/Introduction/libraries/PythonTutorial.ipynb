    "[Python](https://www.python.org/Python) is a high level programming language that is particularly suited for data science and operations research. Python has three main versions labelled 1, 2, and 3. Within each version, there are several minor releases, like 2.2 and 3.3. Therefore, there are many different Python versions labelled  1.x, 2.x, 3.x, where the x is the minor version number. This course covers 3.x but it is not difficult to change from one version to another. \n",

Roughly, this means that you can do operations with variables of different types and Python will make the operation to its best effort to avoid a compilation error.

    "## Libraries\n",
    "In Python, we can import libraries using the keyword import. Libraries encapsulate functions and declare variables that provide additional functionalities and type declarations to provide a specific functionality. In next tutorials, we are going to introduce two libraries, numpy and matplotlib, but before that, you need to know how to import a library. Imports work like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import library as lib\n",
    "```\n",
    "in the code snippet above, we use the keyword import to ask python to import the library *library* and use the alias *lib*. Later on our code, we will be able to use the functions in the library using the alias. Python and Conda allow you to import many useful libraries through import commands, but not every available library. For some libraries, first we will need to install the library in our environment, normally using Conda (but we could also use other tools like pip). This is however everything you need to know for now. You can now check the following tutorials to learn more about **numpy** and **matplotlib**."
