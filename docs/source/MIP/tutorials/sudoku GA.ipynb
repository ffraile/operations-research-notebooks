    "## Evolutionary Algorithms in a nutshell\n",
    "Evolutionary algorithms are a family of algorithms that are inspired by the process of natural selection. The main idea is to represent the solution of the problem as a mathematical object called a **genome**, and to combine different genomes to generate new ones. The genomes that are more fit to the problem are more likely to be selected to generate new genomes, and the process is repeated until a solution is found, or a maximum number of iterations is reached. These are the main steps of an evolutionary algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Generate an initial set of genomes. We will call this set the **population**.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the fitness of each genome in the population.\n",
    "- **Selection**: Select the genomes that are more fit to the problem.\n",
    "- **Crossover**: Combine the selected genomes to generate new genomes.\n",
    "- **Mutation**: Mutate the new genomes.\n",
    "- **Termination**: Check if the termination criteria is met. If not, go to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolutionary algorithms are very flexible, and well-fitted to solve many combinatorial optimization problems. They are also very easy to implement, and they do not require a deep knowledge of the problem to be solved to achieve good results. However, they are not very efficient, and they are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a slightly more extended explanation of Genetic algorithms in this [tutorial](genetic%20algorithms.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Naive approach\n",
    "One of the main advantages of genetic algorithms is that we do not need to have a priori an in-depth knowledge of the \n",
    "problem, we can use simple rules or heuristics to generate the genome of each iteration, and let the fitness function \n",
    "select the fittest alternative. \n",
    "The simplest way to model the Sudoku as a combinatorial optimization problem would be to regard the solution as a \n",
    "permutation of the missing digits. For instance, if we look at the solution of the example above: \n",

    "it is very easy to calculate the values that are missing, just by counting the digits that are present, because we know that each digit appears nine time in the solution. So, with this simple procedure, we can determine at the beginning of the problem which are the digits that are missing: \n",

    "Which is still a really large number of possible combinations! The question is, are they too many for a genetic algorithm\n",
    "to find a solution?\n",
    "We will find out soon enough, but first, let's discuss how our genetic algorithm is going to work. Step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialisation\n",
    "The first step is to generate an initial **genome** (all genes of a set of possible solutions). A gene is going to \n",
    "represent the value of a digit in a position of the Sudoku, and all the genes or chromosome of a solution, all the values\n",
    "of all digits missing in the problem. \n",
    "Basically, to generate the genome of the first population, we can generate just as many permutations of c as\n",
    "the size of the initial population. Say the initial population size is $P$, so initialising the genome is basically to \n",
    "obtain $P$ permutations of $c$. Let us define a function $\\tau(c)$ that randomly re-arranges the items of an array $c$ \n",
    "and therefore returns a random permutation out of all possible permutations. so, our initial genome $G_0$ is going to \n",
    "be just a set of permutations of c: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_0 = [g_{01}, g_{02}, ...g_{0P}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_{0k} = \\tau(c) \\quad \\forall k \\in [1, P]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reference, the numpy function [shuffle](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.shuffle.html) provides such a re-arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Fitness function\n",
    "Now, the second step is to evaluate the fitness function. We can define a fitness function that counts the number of \n",
    "duplicated digits in every row, in every column, and in every 3x3 block. That is, if a digit appears two times in a row, \n",
    "the fitness function will add 1, and if a digit appears twice in a column, it will add 1, same if it appears twice in a \n",
    "block. So let us define this fitness function as $f(g_{ik})$ and obviously the result is going to be an integer number.\n",
    "Furthermore, the $fitness array$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_0 = [f(g_{01}), f(g_{02}), ..., f(g_{0P})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "will contain the fitness of the different candidate solutions in the initial population, and by extension: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_i = [f(g_{i1}), f(g_{i2}), ..., f(g_{iP})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "will contain the fitness of the different candidate solutions in the population at generation $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection function\n",
    "To select the fittest, we just need to select the candidates that contain fewer mistakes, those where the fitness solution\n",
    "is lower. We just need to sort the elements of the fitness array in ascending order and select some of them for the next\n",
    "generation. Let us note the selection function as $\\sigma(f_i)$ and as $S$ the number of individuals\n",
    "that will produce offspring in the next generation. The set of survivals in a generation $i$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_i = \\sigma(f_i) = [s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{iS}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas described, the elements of s will be the $S$ elements of $G_i$ with the lowest fitness function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crossover and mutation\n",
    "We could randomly select two parents from the survivals and combine values in the solution, but we need to ensure that \n",
    "the result is still a permutation of $c$, so for the sake of simplicity, let us not implement any crossover function and \n",
    "focus on the generation of mutations of surviving individuals. To generate a mutation, what we can do is copy some  values randomly from the parent in the exact same position as they are in the parent, and shuffle the remaining values.\n",
    "For instance, imagine that our problem was very easy and only missing 3 values. We could select randomly 1 out of the 3 \n",
    "values and copy it in the exact same location and generate a permutation of the other two elements. If the parent had \n",
    "all the digits of a valid solution, so will the children, and if we are lucky, the permutation will yield a valid \n",
    "solution. \n",
    "Let us note as $R$ the number of digits (or genes) of the parent that we copy, and $N-R$ the number of genes that mutate. \n",
    "Note that, if we select randomly the $(R)$ genes out of the $N$ genes, this is a combination, and therefore, the number\n",
    "of possible combinations of $R$ genes out of the parent is:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$C^N_R = \\frac{N!}{R!(N-R)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, we are going to shuffle the $(N-R)$ remaining genes, so there are  $(N-R)$ different permutations of these \n",
    "genes, that combined with the previous result, yield the following total possible different offspring from a single \n",
    "parent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{N!}{R!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the example above, with $N=51$ gaps or blank positions, if we set $R=49$, there are: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C^{51}_{49} = \\frac{N!}{R!(N-R)!} = \\frac{51!}{49!(51-49)!} = \\frac{51*50*49!}{49!*2!} = \\frac{51*50}{2!} = 1275$$\n",
    "\n",
    "possible ways to combine the genes, and if we multiply by $2!$, we get 2500 different combinations of a parent. \n",
    "Now, this is only for 1 parent, if the selection function lets $S$ survivals, we need to multiply by this factor as well\n",
    "to get the total size of the possible offspring, so for instance, if we set it to 10, the possible different members\n",
    "in a generation is 25000. \n",
    " \n",
    "We really need to fine tune these parameters to make sure that the algorithm is fast, because we need to make sure that \n",
    "we explore a sufficient proportion of all the possible offspring in the iterations. For instance if $R$ is too small, \n",
    "the number of possible children will be too large compared to the population size, and it will be very difficult for the\n",
    "algorithm to find the right solution. Additionally, $(N-R)$ must be at least 2, so that we can at least switch two digits \n",
    "to generate another solution. On the other hand, if the population size is too large compared to the possible offspring\n",
    "our algorithm is inefficient because the population size is too large compared to the possible different offspring, and \n",
    "we will be evaluating several times the same combination of genes in every generation. As a rule of thumb, You need to \n",
    "make sure that the total number of different offspring in a generation is larger than the population size but in the \n",
    "same order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination\n",
    "Finally, we will terminate when we reach a maximum number of iterations, or when we have found the optimal solution. \n",
    "We also need to ensure that we can get rid of *bad batches*, meaning that something can go wrong in the mutations and \n",
    "our algorithm can converge to a solution that can not be fixed with a permutation of N-R numbers of all candidate \n",
    "solution, that is the fitness function can have *local minimum* and our solution can converge to a local minimum, which \n",
    "is not optimal, so if we detect for instance that the fitness function does not change in a number of iterations, \n",
    "we just go back to step 1 and initialise the entire population again. We also need to set another parameter to control \n",
    "the reset, which will represent the maximum number of iterations without improvement in the fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Ok, the following Python script implements this approach. To try it, you just need to provide the values of your Sudoku \n",
    "as a Python Array where the digits in [1-9] define the clues or filled digits in your Sudoku, and the 0s represent the \n",
    "gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyper-parameters\n",
    "The parameters that control the behaviour of the algorithm, or hyperparameters are as described above:\n",
    "- Number of genes that are passed to children in each generation (R). Default: N-R = 2 \n",
    "- Population size, the population size of each generation (P), default: 500\n",
    "- Number of iterations, default: 1000:\n",
    "- Number of survivals in each generation, default 10\n",
    "- Number of iterations without improvement, default 10\n",

    "of all digits missing in the problem. \n",

    "values missing in each column as the size of the initial population. Let us note as $c_j \\quad j \\in [1-9]$ the set of \n",
    "missing values in column $j$. Basically, we need to obtain $P$ permutations of every $c_j$.  \n",
    "We can use the same function $\\tau(c_j)$ to re-arranges the items of an array $c$ and returns a random permutation out \n",

    "\n",
    "###  Fitness function\n",
    "We can use the same fitness function as in the previous approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection function\n",
    "We can apply the same selection function as in the previous approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crossover and mutation\n",
    "Now, let us take a different approach for the cross-over, what we are going to do is to take a number of columns from the \n",
    "parent, and copy them, and then create a mutation by shuffling some values of the remaining columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us note as $R_c$ the number of columns that are passed to the children without mutations. Again, this is a combination\n",
    "of the 9 columns, and the number of possible combinations is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$C^9_{R_c} =  \\frac{9!}{R_c!(9-R_c)!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we set this parameter to 8, there are 9 possible combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to mutate the remaining columns. Let us refer to column j to one of the columns that will mutate. \n",
    "In this case, Let us note as $N_j$ the unknown digits in column j, $R_j$ the number of digits (or genes) of the \n",
    "parent that we copy to column j, and $N_j-R_j$ the number of genes that mutate in that column. There are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C^{N_j}_{R_j} = \\frac{N_j!}{R_j!(N_j-R_j)!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible combinations of genes and $(N_j-R_j)!$ permutations of the genes that mutate. So, again, there are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C^{N_j}_{R_j}*(N_j-R_j)! = \\frac{N_j!}{R_j!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is a combination, but note that, now, the index of the column j is random (we did a random selection of \n",
    "columns), so the maximum number of digits missing are found in columns 3 and 7 that are both missing 8 numbers. \n",
    "So, for instance, if we set $R_c$ to 8, so that we copy 8 columns from the parent, there will be 9 combinations of columns \n",
    "to pass as-is to the next generation.\n",
    "Now, say we fix $(N_j - R_j) to 2, so that we shuffle at most 2 values. We will have, at most: \n",
    "\n",
    "$9*\\frac{8!}{6!} = 9*8*7 = 504$\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible ways to mutate a parent if the algorithm selects to mutate column 3 or column 7. And if we select 10 survivals, \n",
    "we may get an estimation of the total number of offspring as 5040. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things that we need to observe here. First is that the number of combinations is significantly smaller, \n",
    "just as the search space, so we can deal with smaller populations in every generation, which will make each iteration \n",
    "faster, or take another strategies, like increasing the number of survivals in each generation, or the number of\n",
    " columns that we shuffle, to explore the search space faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important thing is that there is uncertainty in the total number of possible offspring, because not\n",
    "all the columns are missing the same number of values and, since the parameters of the algorithm are fixed, the algorithm\n",
    "is not going to be as stable as in the first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination\n",
    "We will terminate using the same approach as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Ok, the following Python script implements this approach. To try it, you just need to provide the values of your Sudoku \n",
    "as a Python Array where the digits in [1-9] define the clues or filled digits in your Sudoku, and the 0s represent the \n",
    "gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyper-parameters\n",
    "The parameters that control the behaviour of the algorithm, or hyperparameters:\n",
