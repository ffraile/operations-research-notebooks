    "We will use the following libraries: \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Networkx](https://networkx.org/): This Python library implements a lot of network theory utils and algorithms and is the main library used in the problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Osmnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): This library allows us to create a graph from an Open Street Maps query (similar to what you would use to find a place in Google Maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will use the following libraries to render the maps:\n",
