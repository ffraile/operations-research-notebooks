    "We can create different types of graphs with the following constructor functions. Review the definitions in the [Graph theory tutorial](Graph%20theory.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```nx.Graph```: Creates an object representing an undirected graph.\n",
    "- ```nx.DiGraph```: Creates an object representing a directed Graph\n",
    "- ```nx.MultiGraph:``` Creates an object representing a with multiple edges between any pair of nodes\n",
    "- ```nx.MultiDiGrpah:``` Directed graph with multiple edges between any pair of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, graphs are created without nodes or edges. The simplest way to add edges and nodes is to use the class methods \n",
    " ```add_node``` and ```add_edge```. The former adds the object that is passed as argument as a node of the graph. We can \n",
    "add as a node a string variable, a numeric, or a tuple with several values which are relevant for our \n",
    "application. In fact, we can add any *hashable* object, any object that will not change during the execution of the \n",
    "program. Functions and objects of user-defined classes are also hashable by default. You can find the precise definition \n",
    "of hashable in the [glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html), but what is important is that Python can assign \n",
    "a unique identifier to each hashable object, and networkx uses these feature to identify each node of the network. \n",
    "Normally, we will use simple types like strings or integers, with different values for each node. \n",
    "The function ```add_edge``` creates and edge passing between two objects are arguments. If the objects are already in \n",
    "the network, it will create an edge between the two, as long as the type of network allows it (if not, it will raise an \n",
    "exception). If any of the objects passed as arguments are not in the network, the function will also add them as nodes. \n",
