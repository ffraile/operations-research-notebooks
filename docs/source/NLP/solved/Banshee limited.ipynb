    "# Optimising the design of headphones\n",
    "## Problem definition\n",
    "You work on the R&D department of Banshee Ltd., a company that manufactures headphones. Through a customer survey you have determined that the level of satisfaction of your headphones is given by the following expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "$z = 5 + ln(x_1) + x_2^2 + x_1*x_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_1$ is the thickness of the diaphragm in microns and $x_2$ is the radius of the diaphragm in millimeters. Due to design constraints, the volume of the driver, which can be estimated as $0.2*\\pi*x_2*x_1$ cannot be larger than 0.172 cubic millimeters. The properties of the material you use makes it unfeasible to manufacture a diaphragm with a thickness lower than $0.3$ microns or higher than $0.9$ microns.\n",
