    "# Planning refreshment production\n",
    "A firm that packs refreshments employs the same syrup to produce its 1.5 l COLI and PEPSA products on its S1 production line. Once processed, each hectolitre of syrup produces 40 units of the 1.5 l COLI product or 20 units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product. If $x_1$ units of the 1.5 l COLI product and $x_2$ units of the 1.5 l PEPSA product are produced, the firm estimates that the daily income obtained in dollars would be given by the following function:\n",

    "$f(x) = 49000·x_1 -x_1^2 + 30·x_2 -2·x_2^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "It costs 150 dollars to buy and process each hectolitre of syrup. The S1 packaging line has a net capacity of producing 56,800 1.5 l product units every day. The firm is committed to produce at least half the amount of PEPSA than COLI. Although priority orders tend to amend its production planning, the firm wishes to have a basic product planning that optimises its daily profits.\n",

    "In this Kuhn-Tucker point, the $\\lambda_1$ is the shadow price of the constraint representing the net capacity and is equal to zero, meaning that the capacity is not binding the profit, and it is not profitable for the company to increase it with extra hours.\n",
    "On the other hand, the shadow price of the second constraint is $\\lambda_2$ is -15323.34, meaning that a unitary change of the function $g_2$ increases the objective function in 15323.34. Since $x_1$ (COLI) is directly proportional to $g_2(x)$, a positive change on the right hand side would increase the profit in 15323.34. Since changes in $x_2$ are multiplied by a factor of -2 in the second constraint, a unitary change of $x_2$ (PEPSA) would decrease the profit in 7661.67."
