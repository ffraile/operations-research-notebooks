    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "Ski Patrol Ltd. manufactures two different models of snowboards branded Normal and Deluxe with a weekly production plan and inventory. They sell their material to local shops. The company obtains a profit of 300€ per Normal snowboard and 400€ per Deluxe snowboard.\n",
    "The manufacturing process consists of roughing and polishing. The Normal snowboard model requires 20 minutes of roughing and 2/3 minutes of polishing. The Deluxe snowboard model requires 40 minutes of roughing and 1 minute of polishing. The roughing equipment is available for 1000 minutes per week and the polishing equipment for 800 minutes per week. \n",
    "Ski Patrol has already signed a contract with a local shop called Downhill Racer to deliver 18 Normal snowboards per week.\n",
