# Introduction to Continuous Linear Programming with Python and Jupyter Notebooks

In this chapter, we will cover both theoretical and practical topics related to Continuous Linear Programming (CLP) using Python. 
CLP allows us to model, solve and analyse the solution of optimization problems using linear equations. "The world is not linear" but still, CLP is a really powerful tool to solve a pletora of real world optimisation problems. 

## Table of contents
- [Graphic solution tutorial](tutorials/graphic-solution-extended.ipynb): This notebook contains a tutorial covering the graphical method. The graphical method is not well suited to solve real problems, but it is a good starting point to understand the fundamentals of CLP.
- [Exercises](exercises/README.md): This section contains CLP exercises. 
- [Solved Exercises](solved/README.md): And this one solved exercises. Students are encourage to try the exercises first. 
- [Simplex method explained](tutorials/Simplex,%20Graphic%20explanation.ipynb): This Notebook explains in detail the Simplex method, one of the most prolific algorithms in history. 
- [Sensitivity, step by step](tutorials/Sensitivity%20-%20Algebraic%20explanation.ipynb): This Notebook shows a step by step algebraic explanation of sensitivity analysis through an example.
