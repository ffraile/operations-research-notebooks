    "As you have seen, changing the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints can have a significant impact on the solution of the linear programming problem. In a nutshell, a sensitivity analysis explores the impact of changes of the coefficients of the objective function and the constraints on the solution of the linear programming problem. A solver providing a sensitivity analysis normally provides the following information:\n",

    "- **Objective function coefficients**: The sensitivity analysis provides the range of values for the coefficients of the objective function for which the current optimal solution remains optimal. Normally, a solver will provide the **upper** and **lower** bounds for the coefficients of the objective function. If the coefficients are within these bounds, the current optimal value of decision variables and constraint slack values will remain optimal. If the coefficients are outside these bounds, the current optimal solution will not be optimal anymore. In the graphic representation, this will mean that the optimal solution will no longer be at the same vertex.\n",
    "- **Right Hand Side (RHS) coefficients**: Similarly, a sensitivity analysis provides the range of values for the Right Hand Side (RHS) coefficients for which the current optimal solution remains optimal. Normally, a solver will provide the **upper** and **lower** bounds for the RHS coefficients. If the coefficients are within these bounds, the current optimal value of decision variables and constraint slack will value remain optimal. If the coefficients are outside these bounds, the current optimal solution will not be optimal anymore. Again, in the graphic representation, this will mean that the optimal solution will no longer be at the same vertex.\n",
