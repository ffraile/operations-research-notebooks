    "## Linear Optimisation with Scipy\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn to model and solve Linear Programming Problems using the Python open source scientific library  [Scipy](https://scipy.org/). SciPy is an awesome library extensively used for scientific and technical computing. It is built on top of NumPy and provides a wide range of functionality including optimization, signal processing, interpolation, and more. It also contains modules for linear algebra, optimization, and integration. SciPy is widely used in the scientific and engineering communities and is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.\n",

    "### Problem function linprog\n",
    "#### Transforming the problem model\n",
    "The function ```linprog``` of the Scipy package can be used to solve continuous linear programming problems expressed in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min z = c^T*x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "s.t.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_{ub}*x \\leq b_{ub}$$\n",
    "$$A_{uc}*x = b_{uc}$$\n",
    "$$l \\leq x \\leq u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is a (column) vector with the decision variables, $c$ is a (column) vector with the objective function coefficients, $z$ is the objective variable (scalar), $A_{ub}$ is a matrix with the LHS coefficients of the constraints of type *less or equal*, and $b_ub$ is a vector that contains the corresponding RHS coefficients of the same constraints, and finally, $A_{uc}$ is a matrix with the LHS coeffients of type *equal*, and $b_ub$ is a vector that contains the corresponding RHS coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need to convert our problem to comply with the format expected by ```linprog```. In our example, we can convert the objective function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min z* = - z = -300*x - 250y = [-300, -250]^T*[x, y]$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, since our objective function is of type *maximize*, we use the equivalent minimization problem and the solution will be the negative of our original objective variable. As for the constraint, we need to express all the constraint (except the bounds) as of type *less_or_equal*. In our case, we do not need to apply any transformation, and our matrix $A_{ub}$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_{ub} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2 & 1\\\\\n",
    "1 & 3\\\\\n",
    "1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the each rows correspond to a constraint, therefore, the vector $b_{ub}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$b_{ub} = [40, 45, 12]^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $l$ is going to contain the minimum values of the decision variables, or **lower bound**. Since both variables need to be non-negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$l = [0, 0]$\n",
    "\n",
    "and finally, $u$ is going to contain the maximum values or **upper bound**, since x cannot be higher than 12, the upper bounds are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$u = [12, \\infty]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the upper bound for x is already expressed in the third constraint. We could remove this constraint and just use the upper bound, but this make it more difficult to obtain the shadow prices from the solution, so for now, we will use this formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### linprog function\n",
    "The documentation of linprog can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html#scipy.optimize.linprog), but in short, it takes the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "**linprog** ***(c, A_ub=None, b_ub=None, A_eq=None, b_eq=None, bounds=None, method='highs')***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c**: 1-D array containing the coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A_ub**: 2-D array (optional). The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of A_ub specifies the coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on x.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b_ub**: 1-D array (optional). The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an upper bound on the corresponding value of A_ub @ x.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A_eq**: 2-D array (optional). The equality constraint matrix. Each row of A_eq specifies the coefficients of a linear equality constraint on x.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b_eq**: 1-D array (optional). The equality constraint vector. Each element of A_eq @ x must equal the corresponding element of b_eq.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bounds**: sequence: (optional). A sequence of (min, max) pairs for each element in x, defining the minimum and maximum values of that decision variable. Use None to indicate that there is no bound. By default, bounds are (0, None) (all decision variables are non-negative). If a single tuple (min, max) is provided, then min and max will serve as bounds for all decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **method**: string (optional). This is the method-specific documentation for ‘highs’, which chooses automatically between ‘highs-ds’ and ‘highs-ipm’. ‘interior-point’ (default), ‘revised simplex’, and ‘simplex’ (legacy) are also available."
