    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "### Problem Class LpProblem\n",
    "PuLP uses *classes* providing different methods to model and solve LPPs. The class that will contain our model is the **LpProblem** class. To create a new LpProblem we use the pulp LpProblem function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LpProblem(name='None', sense=1):** Creates a new Linear Programming Problem. The parameter name (default 'None') assigns a name to the problem. The parameter sense (either pulp.LpMinimise or pulp.LpMaximize) sets the type of objective function. The default is minimise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the line code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = pulp.LpProblem(\"Production_Mix_example\", pulp.LpMaximize)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Created a problem called \"Production_Mix_example\" and set the objective function to maximise."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Variable class LpVariable\n",
    "The definition of a LPP program with PuLP is very similar to the standard procedure used to model a problem. First, we need to define the unknown variables in our problem. For this purpose we use the class **LpVariable**. The function LpVariable allows us to create a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LpVariable(name, lowBound=None, upBound=None, cat='Continuous', e=None):** Creates an instance of variable with the following properties:\n",
    "    - **Name:** The name of the variable to be used in the solution. \n",
    "    - **lowBoud:** The lower bound of the variable, the default is unsrestricted (-Inf).\n",
    "    - **upBound:** The upper bound of the variable. The default is unrestricted (Inf).\n",
    "    - **cat:** Either 'Continuous' for continuous variables, 'Binary' for binary variables or 'Integer' for Integer variables. We will see in detail binary and integer variables in the course unit for Mixed Integer Programming, but now you know that you will be able to model and solve this type of problems with PuLP. The default is 'Continuous'.\n",
    "    - **e:** This parameter is outside the scope of this course and can be neglected for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the variables of our problem using the LpVariable function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create the variables of the problem\n",
    "x = pulp.LpVariable('x', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n",
    "y = pulp.LpVariable('y', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have created two variables, x and y, with lower bound 0 and type continuous. We could have also use ```upBound``` to set the upper bound of the variables. For instance, if we wanted to set the upper bound of x to 12, we could have used this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding expressions\n",
    "In PuLP, both objective function and constraints are *expressions* (algebraic expressions containing variables) that have to be added to the instance problem using the standard operand '+='. For instance, to add the objective function in this example, we could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model += 300 * x + 250 * y, \"Profit\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "With this line of code, we have added a new expression with name \"Profit\" that multiplies the technological coefficients to the variables ```x``` and ```y``` (as defined in the code snippet in the previous section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have used the operand '+=' to add the expression to the ```model``` variable. We can use the same procedure to add the constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# And the constraints\n",
    "model += 2 * x + y <= 40, \"Man Power\"\n",
    "model += x + 3 * y <= 45, \"Machine Operating Time\"\n",
    "model += x <=12, \"Marketing\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we added names to the constraints. This is not mandatory, but it is a good practice to do so. Note also that we needed one line of code per constraint. This is not a problem for this simple example, but it can be a problem for more complex problems. We will see how to solve this issue in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the problem\n",
    "Once we have defined the problem, we can solve it using the **solve** method of the LpProblem class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# solve the problem\n",
    "model.solve()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have not specified any solver. PuLP will use the default solver (CBC) to solve the problem. We will see in next chapters how to use other solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the status of the solution\n",
    "Once the problem has been solved, we can check the status of the solution using the **LpStatus** method of the LpProblem class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pulp.LpStatus[model.status]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The status of the solution can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal:** An optimal solution has been found.\n",
    "- **Not Solved:** The problem has not been solved yet.\n",
    "- **Infeasible:** There are no feasible solutions (e.g. if you set the constraints x <= 1 and x >=2).\n",
    "- **Unbounded:** The constraints are not bounded, maximising the solution will tend towards infinity (e.g. if the only constraint was x >= 3).\n",
    "- **Undefined:** The optimal solution may exist but may not have been found.\n",
    "- **Error:** An error occurred (e.g. if you try to retrieve the infeasible or unbounded status from a model which is not infeasible or unbounded).\n",
    "- **None:** No solution status exists (e.g. if you create a model but do not solve it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving the solution\n",
    "Once the problem has been solved, we can retrieve the solution using the **varValue** method of the LpVariable class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(x.varValue)\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Making PuLP programs more scalable\n",
    "In this section, we will see how to make PuLP programs more scalable. We will use some Python basic concepts related to iterables. You can check these tutorials if you need a refresher:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Basic Python Iterators](https://programming.engineeringcodehub.com/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Iterable%20Objects%20I.html)\n",
    "- [Intermediate Python Iterators](https://programming.engineeringcodehub.com/en/latest/Introduction/tutorials/Iterable%20Objects%20II.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using dictionary variables\n",
    "Note however that if we use the script above, the problem just does not scale up because **we need a line of code for every unknown**. What if we have hundreds of unknowns? Luckily for us, PuLP provides a convenient method to write more efficient codes for our program, the **LpVariable.dicts** method, which basically allows us to create a set of variables with the same category, upper bounds and lower bounds at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LpVariable.dicts(name, index, lowBound=None, upBound=None, cat='Continuous')**: Creates a dictionary containing variables of type cat (default 'Continuous'), indexed with the keys contained in the *iterable* index and bounded by lowBound (default -Inf) and upBound (default Inf).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we can define our variables using the LpVariable.dicts method like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First we define a tuple with the variable names x and y\n",
    "variable_names = (1,2)\n",
    "# Then we create a variable from a dictionary, using the variable names as keys\n",
    "X = pulp.LpVariable.dicts(\"vars\", variable_names, lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we used a **tuple** with the variable names to create both variables in a single line of code. If we had 20 variables, we could have used a tuple with the 20 variable names and created all the variables in a single line of code. This is a much more scalable way to create variables in PuLP!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using lpSum\n",
    "We can also use the **lpSum** function to create linear expressions from a vector of variables, just as we can use summations to express the objective function and constraints in a more compact mathematical form. For instance, we can write the objective function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C = [c_1, c_2] = [300, 250]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$X = [x_1, x_2]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\max z = 300x_1 + 250x_2 = \\sum_{j=1}{2}{c_j*x_j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PuLP provides a convenience function named ```lpSum``` to achieve the same result efficiency. *lpSum* takes an array of expressions and returns the summation of the elements in the array. Let us see it action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We define the objective function coefficients\n",
    "C = [300, 250]\n",
    "# Then we add the objective function to the model like\n",
    "model += (\n",
    "    pulp.lpSum([\n",
    "        C[i] * X[variable_names[i]]\n",
    "        for i in range(len(X))])\n",
    "), \"Profit\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have used **list comprehension** to create the array where every element is the product of a coefficient times the corresponding decision variable, and passed this array to the lpSum function using an index array. We have used **range** and **length** to go through all decision variables.\n"

   "source": [
    "### Using matrices and arrays to define problem constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use matrices and arrays to define the constraints of the problem. For instance, we can write the constraints of the problem like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "$\\sum_{j=1}^{2}{a_{ij}*x_j} \\leq b_i \\forall i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "# need We also define the name for the constraints\n",

    "constraint_names = ['Man Power', 'Machine Operating Time', 'Marketing']\n",
    "# Now we add the constraints using\n",
    "# model += expression, name\n",
    "# eg model += 2*X + y <= 40\n",
    "# We add all constraints in a loop, using a vector and the function lpSum to generate the linear expression:\n",
